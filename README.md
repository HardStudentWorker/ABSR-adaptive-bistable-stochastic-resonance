# ABSR-adaptive-stochastic-resonance
Code for reproducing ABSR-DED of paper "Adaptive Bistable Stochastic Resonance Aided Spectrum Sensing"

This is the part MATLAB2021b code for reproducing paper [1]. The more specific detail is obtained from the corresponding dissertation [2].

Hope to help researchers of relevant research fields. Look forward to your feekback and learning from each other.
